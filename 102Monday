## Welcome to Markdown101!

-Mark down is where there is minimal annotation to dictate the behavior of text, whenever this be just a title, paragraph or heading! 

-An example of this is "##" being a markdown to make text a heading, or "-" to make a listing. This cleans up the text in a more presentable manner, this could be a much easier method to create a website relative to markup languages such as HTML or CSS where the number of types of annotations you could make are far greater and generally more complicated.

-Most users would learn markdown in a matter of minutes as it is generally straight forwards, commonly used WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) generators or HTML generators.
