# Intro and table of contents!
## Who is Tomothy?

I am Thomas Moore, I like motorbikes and 3d printing.. Been obsessing over my printer for the Half month, It's pretty fun but generally has a lower than I'd like it success rate however these days my baby is doing better :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:	

First day - I spent a good few hours assembling it, and admitedly I'm not great at assembly :) - The Model is an Aquila C2 which is meant to be an ender 3 clone with a slight upgrade. An entry level 3d printer costing around Â£180 on amazon.

![Assembly, alan key horrors!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053702-6e824744-5633-438f-9348-c8a55d054085.jpg) -Me assembling it, didn't realise it came with an alan key so ended up spending a good while messing around with a modular alan key.

## What is this?

This is as part of my coding course, where I will learn how to be a master coder.
