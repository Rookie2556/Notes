# Intro and table of contents!
## Who is Tomothy?

I am Thomas Moore, I like motorbikes and 3d printing.. Been obsessing over my printer for the Half month, It's pretty fun but generally has a lower than I'd like it success rate however these days my baby is doing better :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:	

First day - I spent a good few hours assembling it, and admitedly I'm not great at assembly :) - The Model is an Aquila C2 which is meant to be an ender 3 clone with a slight upgrade. An entry level 3d printer costing around Â£180 on amazon.

*Me assembling it, didn't realise it came with an alan key so ended up spending a good while messing around with a modular alan key.*

![Assembly, alan key horrors!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053702-6e824744-5633-438f-9348-c8a55d054085.jpg) 

*hard day of work and it was completed! (probably would've been faster if I knew what I was doing)*
![Whoo Assembled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053722-71807b3c-2c61-451e-b48d-43c1fd4cf312.jpg)

*Patrick design, I was very proud of this as this was my first time interacting with designing software!*

![Successful prints (red)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053751-d41a3726-b5db-4057-ad08-2fa145cab68c.jpg)

*Ran out of plastic, the printer came with 0.05kg Red PLA filament, notice how the skull is half way?*

![spatula 3000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053803-06836ac6-fed8-48da-9abc-ae499d515d4a.jpg)

*The Spatula 3000 in an episode of spongebob that I thought was funny.*

*Successfully printed patrick twice, although they have no detail so I learnt to add more depth to line art. (though never printed again of course.)

![Success rate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053817-d405a6bf-4617-4a62-abd5-3a8a51b218f2.jpg)

*At this point in time, my success rate was appaling, 7 successful prints in a sea of >fish poo
as my friend calls it.

![Printed armrest delete for someone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053814-301b0b6a-dd79-451b-9b52-d13110ec36f6.jpg)

*Printed an armrest delete for a friend, also printed a first gear retainer for his ford mk4 1998 or something, idk I'm not too familiar with cars. That retainer snapped as he put too much force onto it and so I printed another and that one works!

*This took 10+ prints to get all the pieces over a span of roughly a week, I intend to sand and put this together, then spray paint it eventually.*

![Phone case](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053794-db718217-fdbc-4b93-a081-71441c0e5c58.jpg)

*Printed a phone case but the quality was bad and the plastic was too hard, so I started researching into plastics and ordered some. Perks of living in rural areas, stuff take ages to come here :upside_down_face:

![It's PRINTING!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053790-f8440566-8134-425c-a5f3-8b40b9279bd3.jpg)

*ITS ALIVE!!!! err, I mean - after assembling it and calibrating the bed (and a few noodles of failed prints...)*


## What is this?

This is as part of my coding course, where I will learn how to be a master coder.
