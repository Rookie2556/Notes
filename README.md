## Who is Tomothy?

I am ``Thomas Moore``, I like motorbikes, coding/general computer stuff and 3d printing.. Whenever I am currently in a phase of liking something, it is my whole personality, and this is supposed to be my bio sooo...

*I've been obsessing over my printer for the last half a month, it's pretty fun but generally has a lower than I'd like it success rate however these days my baby is doing better* ðŸ¥°

``First day owning a 3d printer, 3rd January 2023`` - *I spent a good few hours assembling it, and admitedly I'm not great at assembly :) - The Model is an Aquila C2 which is meant to be an ender 3 clone with a slight upgrade. An entry level 3d printer costing around Â£180 on amazon.*

*Me assembling it, didn't realise it came with an alan key so ended up spending a good while messing around with a modular alan key.*

![Assembly, alan key horrors!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053702-6e824744-5633-438f-9348-c8a55d054085.jpg) 

*A hard days of work and it was completed! (probably would've been faster if I knew what I was doing)*
![Whoo Assembled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053722-71807b3c-2c61-451e-b48d-43c1fd4cf312.jpg)

*ITS ALIVE!!!! err, I mean - after assembling it and calibrating the bed (and a few noodles of failed prints...)*
![Printing for first time, test hook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213061764-52aaa01e-a817-4ace-ab75-c264cef8ac54.mp4)

*The print is failing... **failing** - I was shocked. Didn't know what I did wrong..*
![reckon this one is failing?](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213061867-2d0d0005-8b97-4d87-a684-e4cc1315ad6c.mp4)

*Ran out of plastic, the printer came with 0.05kg Red PLA filament, notice how the skull is half way?*
![Successful prints (red)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053751-d41a3726-b5db-4057-ad08-2fa145cab68c.jpg)

*Patrick design, I was very proud of this as this was my first time interacting with designing software!*
![Patrick designed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053731-f3473487-289c-45e7-8c6d-7e9e49d924f2.jpg)

*Successfully printed patrick twice, although they have no detail so I learnt to add more depth to line art. (though never printed again of course.)*

![2 Patricks! I cannot believe my eyes, there's two of them!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053817-d405a6bf-4617-4a62-abd5-3a8a51b218f2.jpg)

*Patrick design, intended to put them together eventually but due to incorrect materials I am going to continue this at a later date.* (read on you'll find out)

![Patrick Phone design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213061444-c4c5cecf-ccd5-4821-a196-7b1da986fd7f.jpg)

*I LEFT IT OVERNIGHT!!! SO MUCH PLASTIC WASTED*
![wasting plastic :/](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213061544-f46a395d-ed59-4358-afb7-d8e27ab713d2.jpg)

*At this point in time, my success rate was appaling, 7 successful prints in a sea of ``"fish poo"``
as my friend calls it.*
![Success rate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053814-301b0b6a-dd79-451b-9b52-d13110ec36f6.jpg)

*Printed a phone case but the quality was bad and the plastic was too hard, so I started researching into TPU ABS PLA and a bunch of other plastics and ordered some TPU. Perks of living in rural areas, stuff take ages to come here* ðŸ™ƒ

![Phone case, hexagon design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053790-f8440566-8134-425c-a5f3-8b40b9279bd3.jpg)

*Printed an armrest delete for a friend, also printed a first gear retainer for his ford mk4 1998 or something, a seatbelt cover and errr idk I'm not too familiar with cars. That retainer snapped as he put too much force onto it and so I printed another and that one works and is currently in use!*

*This Finns's blue sword took 10+ prints to get all the pieces over a span of roughly a week, I intend to sand and put this together, then spray paint it eventually.* (buttttt got sidetracked)

![Finn sword](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213053794-db718217-fdbc-4b93-a081-71441c0e5c58.jpg)

*I don't even watch adventure time, this was using someone else's stl designs..*

*I learnt to adapt, my taller prints were falling over and thus, failing to print properly - my solution? SELOTAPE THAT TO THE BED* (There were no bed glue near me and I can't wait for another parcel again, I have PTSD from waiting for the Blue plastic)

![Shaking issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213061921-9d37f17c-0e13-4dae-84ef-1a3a7f641c76.mp4)

*Sponge using the spatula 3000 in the show, I found this funny and started wondering... also was my reference photo*

*I had spent a few nights learning how to use 3d software to make my own design of spatula 3000, it ain't perfect but it's mine* ðŸ’”
![SpongeSpats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213056396-3bf12648-ac83-49f4-8396-55b87a1c395d.png)

*Sliced it into two so it'd be easier on me to print in one go and so I didnt have to use supports for the previously levitating metal part of the spatula.*

![spatVoxelmaker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122787483/213056410-732f899f-b263-4cfa-a33b-321cb207c9cc.png)

*I've yet to start printing the spatula 3000. This whole experience has been fun, taught me troubleshooting and admitedly makeshift solutions and a whole bunch of software I'd never interacted with. ``I'm lovin'it`` wait no this isn't macdonalds ooo I could try design a plastic burger* ðŸ˜²

## So, What is the point of this page?

This page in particular is to introduce myself, tell you about me and provide a table of links leading to notes I've made throughout my coding course, to become a master coder ðŸ˜Ž
