## What is Growth mindset?

Growth mindset is beleiving that the reason you can't do something YET is because you haven't gone through the motions of learning the process well and creatively.

Growth mindset is a very popular topic, I had covered this in college, it is an important concept to grasp as it allows pathways to success to be more productive and fruitful.

The contrast to this is a >fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.
this is a bad lazy mindset as it allows for individuals to believe they cannot succeed or can only succeed if they understand it the first time round which is definitely not the case with more difficult tasks.

According to https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset, the above is conformed. 

Most will have experienced some form of fixed mindset however accidental, and through life we learn that it's okay to not grasp everything or do anything first time as we are constantly growing as individuals, we need to overcome any *obstacles* that may be learning curves or issues we find. It is important that we keep a growth mindset through our work and general lifestyles.

## How Do you stay in growth mindset?

- One such method could be that you set up reminders of growth mindet around your room - an encoraging poster with a kitten saying > "You can do it!" ![Rockin cat](https://media.tenor.com/8TuHoy4DokYAAAAC/cat-you-got-this.gif)

- Another method could be to seek feedback and constructive critism (plain mean critism helps no one), when this could be a friend, a boss or even your little brother Steven (if he's old enough, my brother steven is 4 years old so probably wouldn't be helpful for software engineering feedback..)

- Finally, Self feedback - review your own actions and learn from ``misttakes`` <s> mistKES </s> mistakes every once in a while, this would force yourself to recognise where you've improved, make new strategies for improvements and both whats' going well, and well... not.

## 2 Labs in one day? Err Welcome to Markdown101!

According to google Markdown's definition is as follows: 
> markdown
> /ˈmɑːkdaʊn/
> Learn to pronounce
> noun
> a reduction in price.
> "markdowns of up to 50 per cent on many items"

*mmm, perhaps google is talking about something else :/..* 

Mark down is where there is minimal annotation to dictate the behavior of text, whenever this be just a title, paragraph or heading or for short, a lightweight variation of markup languages e.g. a lighter version of html, markdown is used in github.

- An example of this is "##" being a markdown to make text a h2 heading, or "-" to make a listing. This cleans up the text in a more presentable manner, this could be a much easier method to create a website relative to markup languages such as HTML or CSS where the number of types of annotations you could make are far greater and generally more complicated.

- Another example is > Quoting speech , another could be listing, as such this list was created using dashes!

- Most users would learn markdown in a matter of minutes as it is generally straight forwards, commonly used WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) generators or HTML generators.

Most Markdowns have fairly similar syntax as such <b> usually means bold, <i> italics et cetera. One would even be able to use alternative syntax such as ** bold ** using double asterisks or <b>
  
Some of the common syntax include: <p> </p> for paragraphs, <br> </br> break lines, a single asterisk or <i></i>, Blockquoting > paragraphs >> nesting blockquotes
  
Unordered listing - to include a different listing style within would cause an effect like so:
  
- a
- b
  - c
  
        Code blocks
  <.html> whoooo <./html>
          -![alt title](Link) - An image! V useful much wowsers
            -[title] (link)
          
  
It is considered good practice to be aware of spacing, as such between the tag and text and blank lines before/after for easy compatibility.

  **Not gonna lie, to me there is not too much difference between markdown and markup, but essentially Markdown is just easier and less detailed.
