## This is my reading notes for tuesday's work

- I learnt how to use ubtuntu properly and can say my confidence working almost purely by cmd line is much better and I found todays' lesson!
- I am still attempting to understand the concepts introduced to me but feel as I understand far more than I did yesterday
- We had covered remote git and github, push pull add . dir rm commit -m -rf and avoided merging needlessly
- git cloning, then creating directories mkdir, dir to find the folders, cd
- touch to make files, .md to make them editable within github, staging and renaming mv

## Things I want to know more about

- I had to type out "file1.md file2.md..." to 8 and to 15 multiple times, is there a faster way to type this out e.g. file{1-8}.md?
