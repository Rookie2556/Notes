# 2 Reads in one day? Err Welcome to Markdown101!

According to google Markdown's definition is as follows: 
> markdown
> /ˈmɑːkdaʊn/
> Learn to pronounce
> noun
> a reduction in price.
> "markdowns of up to 50 per cent on many items"

*mmm, perhaps google is talking about something else :/..* 

Mark down is where there is minimal annotation to dictate the behavior of text, whenever this be just a title, paragraph or heading or for short, a lightweight variation of markup languages e.g. a lighter version of html, markdown is used in github.

- An example of this is "##" being a markdown to make text a h2 heading, or "-" to make a listing. This cleans up the text in a more presentable manner, this could be a much easier method to create a website relative to markup languages such as HTML or CSS where the number of types of annotations you could make are far greater and generally more complicated.

- Another example is > Quoting speech , another could be listing, as such this list was created using dashes!

- Most users would learn markdown in a matter of minutes as it is generally straight forwards, commonly used WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) generators or HTML generators.

Most Markdowns have fairly similar syntax as such <b> usually means bold, <i> italics et cetera. One would even be able to use alternative syntax such as ** bold ** using double asterisks or <b>
  
Some of the common syntax include: <p> </p> for paragraphs, <br> </br> break lines, a single asterisk or <i></i>, Blockquoting > paragraphs >> nesting blockquotes
  
Unordered listing - to include a different listing style within would cause an effect like so:
  
- a
- b
  - c
  
        Code blocks - just indent 4/8 times for me!
  <.html> whoooo <./html>
          -![alt title](Link) - An image! V useful much wowsers
            -[title] (link)
          
  
It is considered good practice to be aware of spacing, as such between the tag and text and blank lines before/after for easy compatibility.

  **Not gonna lie, to me there is not too much difference between markdown and markup, but essentially Markdown is just easier and less detailed.
