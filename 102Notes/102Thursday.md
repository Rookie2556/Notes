#Designing webpages with CSS

###What is CSS?

**css is Cascading style sheet**, a simple syntax language to mark up HTML files and *bruches* up the professionalism to an extent..

HTML is the most common file however there is:

- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)  > Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation.
- XML(Extensible Markup Language) > Extensible Markup Language is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

The file is presented via a medium such as chrome, firefox or ~~edge~~ for users on the web, projectors or printers.

### CSS Syntax

Css is a rule based language, it gives rules to existing files - e.g. .container p would mean within the file container, a paragraph
will be affected by the rules specified, such as **colour**, *format*, font, sizing et cetera.

        h1 {
        color: red;
        font-size: 5em;
        }
