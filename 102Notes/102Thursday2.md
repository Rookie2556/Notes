# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript!

[JavaScript MDN web docs very good for revising](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

Note - Java script and java are comlpetely unrelated ðŸ˜¥

## Intro to JavaScript

JS is a lightweight compiled in real time programming language with *first class functions*

first class functions is, according to google:

> First-class function
> In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens.

According to Reddit's "Explain like I'm 5": >It's like a toy box where you have different types of toys, like cars, dolls, and balls. You can put a toy in a box, take it out of the box, give it to your friend, and put it back in the box.
> Functions are like toys, you can store them in variables, take them out, and use them when you need them.

> In most popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other data type.

Java Script is the highest level programming language we've encountered so far in this course, and so it is **Not** markdown/markup
It is ``real`` code!
