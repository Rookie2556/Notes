# Psychological safety

## What google learned from its quest to build the perfect team Questions

What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
    The interactions are friendly, and well intended - critisms aren't ill intended.
    There is no dread towards the group as such stressful et cetera, everyone listens equally and respectfully while staying on track.
    It is structured and there isn't any "competing" for leadership, it is estabilished. 
Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
    In a university game development team, I felt that I had no place in a team as I'd missed a meeting in which roles were handed out
    for a hearing aid appointment, I felt that it was technically 'sorted' however, it was arbitary, as such my roles were almost
    made up and I genuinely had no input in the overall output that is the game. I still got the same grade as everyone involved
    but felt like I contributed nothing which effected my overall mood for that period of time.
What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
    productivity massively declines or improves based on the overall psychological safety of its' workers, the rate in which 
    tasks are completed collectively and errors are more likely to be fixed and the overall quality of work completed is also 
    of that a higher standard.
