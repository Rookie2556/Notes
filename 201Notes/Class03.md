## Learn HTML

*The most fundamental component of the Web is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It describes the purpose and organisation of 
web content. The appearance/presentation (CSS) and functionality/behavior (JS) of a web page are typically described 
using technologies other than HTML (JavaScript).

Links that join online pages together, either within a single website or between websites, are referred to as "hypertext." 
An essential component of the Web are links. You can participate actively in the World Wide Web by publishing content
online and linking it to other people's web pages. *

Markup is used to change the basic text to a format, using tags such as:

```
<head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, 
<audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
 ```
