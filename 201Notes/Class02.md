## Basics of HTML CSS and JS

### Introduction to HTML:

*HTML is a mark up language, used to make the structure of a website, it is usually very bland looking and contains the basics
such as paragraphing, imagery titles and any other contents a website may have. At this stage any decoration and interactivity is
very limited.*

``` <head> ```

Contains information about the website that isn't displayed and any links to scripts used et cetera. 

``` </head> ```

``` <a src=LinkwouldLeadhere.com>```
This is a hyper Link, where the information here would be shown to the user
``` </a> ```

- Semenatic is important as it boosts our SEO and ensures that the structure of the website is proper and allows for easier
  readability when viewing the code and the website in two different senses.
  
- There are 6 levels of html headings, h1 to h6, where h6 is smallest and h1 is largest.

- <sup> makes a text smaller and held higher than the base line text, like cubed would be held, <sub> is the same, but lower instead.
  
- ``` <abbr> ``` must be closed by ``` </abbr> ``` in order to be used correctly.
